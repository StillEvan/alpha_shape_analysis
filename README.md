Alpha Shape Analysis tool for APT data

This Python module complements a submitted manuscript titled "Alpha Shape Analysis (ASA) Framework for Post Clustering Property Determination in Atom Probe Tomographic Data" by Evan K. Still, Dan K. Schreiber, Jing Wang, and Peter Hosemann.

Running the accuracy scripts will generate comparable synthetic data for accuracy assessment as presented in the manuscript.
Alpha Shape Analysis requires python > 3.6 and the following packages are required for use of ASA and the associated scripts: numpy, networkx, scipy, pandas, warnings, matplotlib, lmfit, and sklearn

See the manuscript for details on the correction method. Please contact evanstill@berkeley.edu with any questions about the code.
